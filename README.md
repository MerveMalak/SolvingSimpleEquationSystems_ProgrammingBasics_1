# CENG113-PROGRAMMING BASICS
# ASSIGNMENT 1- SolvingSimpleEquationSystems_ProgrammingBasics_1
Please implement a program that solves an equation system consisting of 2 linear equations each of
which contains the same 2 variables.
An example run:
+2x-2y+5+4y=+18-1x
Enter the second equation:
-10y+5x-4y+10y=+7
Equations in the simplified form:
3x+2y=13
5x-4y=7
Solution:
x=3
y=2
  Pay attention to the the colors: inputs and outputs of the program.
  The submissions will be mostly graded automatically (not manually by a human), so the outputs should be ***exactly** the same (For example, you need something like this: eq1 = input("Enter the first equation: \n "). Mind the newline at the end). In the simplified form, show the terms even if their coefficients are 0 (e.g. 2x+0y=5) and show the coefficients even if they are 1 (e.g. 1x+3y=8). Both for the simplified form and the solutions display x first and then y .
